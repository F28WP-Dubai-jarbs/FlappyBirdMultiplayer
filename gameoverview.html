                A 10-player multiplayer game with a pvp/pve style gameplay of 5 minutes.
                The game begins with one player being assigned as the zombie chicken in random.
                The zombie chicken will then aim to convert all survivor chickens by killing them.
                Survivors may defend themselves using weapons or use the map and barriers to their advantage.
                A player wins if he survives till the end or if he has converted all survivors to zombies.
                Therefore the goal of the game is to survive, or if converted, then convert all survivors.
