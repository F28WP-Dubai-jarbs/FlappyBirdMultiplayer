# Multiplayer Flappy Bird

This project implements a multiplayer version of the classic game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) but now its a fish.

It implements the client/server communication strategy for the game which works over WebSockets using [Ably's](https://www.ably.io) realtime messaging infrastructure.
